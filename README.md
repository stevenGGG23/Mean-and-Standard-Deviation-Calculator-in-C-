This C++ program reads numerical values from a file, calculates the mean and standard deviation, and displays the results with two decimal precision.

## Features
- Reads values from a user-specified file
- Computes the **mean** and **population standard deviation**
- Displays results in a clean format
- Ensures proper file handling

## How to Use
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o stats_calculator main.cpp -lm

Enter the data file name: numbers.txt

The values read are: 5.0 10.0 15.0 20.0 25.0
